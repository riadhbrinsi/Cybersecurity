NIS2 is a new set of regulations that aim to improve the cybersecurity of critical infrastructure within the European Union. NIS2 requires certain entities within member nations, including many manufacturers, to take appropriate measures to manage and mitigate the risks posed to their network and information systems.

All relevant organizations within the EU are expected to comply with the new requirements in 2024.
